# PassMan

Passman is a password manager for everyday use.

It uses AES 256 encryption which is strong enough to keep your passwords safe.

The master password is the key to unlock all of your passwords.

Warning! if you forget the  master password, there is no way to get the other passwords back.

The PMkey.md5 and passwords.pmdb files in your documents folder is the holder of your passwords.

Don't loose those files even if the application is lost.
